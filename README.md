## Getting Started
Node.js 20 or newer is recommended.

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the development server
npm run dev
# Visit http://localhost:3000
```

### Lint & Production Build
```bash
npm run lint    # ESLint checks
npm run build   # Production bundle
npm run start   # Serve the build output
```

## Deployment
Deploy to Vercel, Netlify, or any static-compatible host. Because the site does not rely on environment variables or server-side data sources, deployment configuration remains lightweight.

## Customization Tips
- Modify the `projects` array in `src/components/Projects.tsx` to feature new work.
- Update the `Intl.DateTimeFormat` options in `Hero.tsx` to display different time zones.
- Adjust global colors and typography through `globals.css` or Tailwind theme tokens.
